# Icarus

> Node Environment Deploy Manager

Command-line tool to help deploying apps from git.  Also communicates
with nyx to support proxying to newly deployed apps.

Also deployable as an http server for listening and responding to requests.

> Still in early-alpha, infact, not even alpha, _pre-alpha at best_.
